## Acknowledgments

This addon is inspired by [EquipmentSets](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/equipmentsets) by [Fr0stwing](https://www.curseforge.com/members/fr0stwing/projects). EquipmentSets works well and covers most of my needs but I wanted to know how it was working and maybe add some features.
So this is not realy a fork as I plan to rewrite all the code but without EquipmentSets this addon would not exist.
